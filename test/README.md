just test files, all of these files have

```py
from time import sleep
print("hello world!")
sleep(15)
```

except for `roblox.exe, omg-free-nitro.exe and hazardv2.exe`:

- **Roblox.exe** is the actually roblox exe lmao
- **hazardv2.exe** is compiled version of [hazard.v2](https://github.com/Rdimo/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V2) it's the original source so running it will put the injection in and kill your discord but I put an invalid webhook in it so your info wont get stolen if you accidently run it
- **omg-free-nitro.exe** just compiled cpp file that either prints out "hello world" or has embeded python code that prints out hello world

the rest of the files have their compiler in their name and what type
